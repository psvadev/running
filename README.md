# Puls

A self-contained single-file running tracker that replaces a multi-tab Excel workbook. Norwegian UI throughout.

## Features

### Logging
- Log runs with date, session type, training plan, duration, distance, HR (avg + max), 5 HR zones, calories, pace, avg km/h, incline, shoe, sleep, and **run type** (outdoor / treadmill)
- Auto-calculated fields: duration (summed from zones), pace, avg km/h
- Edit any past session by clicking it in the log

### Dashboard (Oversikt)
- **Yearly goal card** — progress bar with km done, km remaining, year-end projection, and required weekly km to stay on track
- **Rekorder** — best pace, longest session (time + distance), best avg km/h, total distance and time, best week, longest streak, current streak, best Easy pace, best Langtur pace, best aerobic efficiency; plus distance PRs for 5 km, 10 km, half marathon, and marathon
- **Innsikter** — dynamic pool of insight candidates ranked by priority and recency; top 6 shown: km milestones (passed and upcoming), shoe retirement warnings, most-used shoe, heaviest 4-week training block, fastest Easy run, most active month, Easy pace trend (last 8 vs prior 8 weeks), days since last run
- **Treningsrytme** — consistency score 0–100 over the last 12 weeks (active-week rate, volume threshold weeks, streak bonus); score breakdown bars show contribution of each component (max 50/30/20 pts); configurable km/run-count thresholds in Settings; monthly active-weeks trend chart
- **Treningsblokker** — auto-generated training block cards from Plan events; active block is a full-width hero card with consistency progress bar and weekly km sparkline; past blocks shown as compact cards below; click any card for a rich drill-down: weekly progression bars (each row clickable → week detail; badges for Toppuke / Lengste løp / Raskest), auto-generated highlights (best week, longest run, streak, pace trend), consistency breakdown, comparison vs previous block, and full run list
- **Treningsbelastning per uke** — weekly training load scored by zone intensity (Z1=1 … Z5=5 points/min), color-coded bars with 4-week rolling average
- **Treningsstatus (PMC)** — Performance Management Chart: Fitness (CTL, 42-day), Fatigue (ATL, 7-day), and Form (TSB = CTL−ATL) over the last 365 days
- **Ukentlig distanse** — km per week, last 20 weeks
- **Tempo per uke** — weighted average pace per week
- **Aerob effektivitet** — aerobic efficiency trend for Easy sessions (speed ÷ heart rate), with rolling average and personal average reference line; venue toggle (Alle / Utendørs / Tredemølle) to slice by run type
- **Tempo i sone 2** — pace trend over time for Easy + Langtur sessions, with 4-session rolling average; Y-axis inverted so improving pace trends upward; toggle to isolate Easy or Langtur
- **Søvn vs puls** — scatter plot of sleep duration vs avg HR per session; linear regression trend line; per-type color coding in Alle mode; default filter: Easy
- **Tempo vs puls** — scatter plot of avg HR vs pace per session; shows whether pace improves at the same or lower HR; same color coding and filter toggle as Søvn vs puls
- **Interactive charts** — hover any weekly chart for a full week summary (km, løp, tid, tempo, HR); click a bar/point to open a drill-down detail panel for that week; click a shoe bar to open shoe detail; click a heatmap day to open session or week detail
- **Ute vs inne** — weekly stacked bar splitting km between outdoor (🏃) and treadmill (⚙️); hidden until first treadmill session is logged
- **Pulssoner** — stacked minutes per zone per week or month (toggle)
- **Årssammenligning** — cumulative km by week number, one line per year
- **Sko oversikt** — total km per shoe pair + per-shoe stats: run count, avg pace, avg HR, last used date
- **Ukentlig oversikt** — scrollable summary table (sessions, distance, time, avg pace per week)

Dashboard filters: session type, training plan, run type (outdoor/treadmill), **tempo unit (min/km ↔ km/t)**, year pills — all charts update live. The tempo unit toggle switches "Tempo per uke", "Tempo i sone 2", and "Tempo vs puls" between pace and speed simultaneously. **Nullstill** resets all filters including chart-local type pills, the pace unit toggle, and the Pulssoner Uke/Måned toggle.

**Mobile:** all charts resize to fit the screen width — no horizontal page scrolling. The training calendar scrolls horizontally within its own card.

### Session log (Treningslogg)
- Full sortable table — click any column header to sort
- **Sleep column** colour-coded at a glance: red `< 6h` · yellow `6–7h` · green `≥ 7h`
- **Mobile:** secondary columns hidden automatically (week, name, plan, target km, duration, max HR, calories, shoe, sleep); all fields still visible when opening the edit form
- Filter by date range, session type, run type (outdoor/treadmill), and shoe
- Edit or delete any row
- **Export for AI chat** — checkbox column to select one or more sessions; **Kopier valgte** copies selected rows, **Kopier alle filtrerte** copies the full filtered view, **Last ned TSV** downloads as a file; TSV format matches the original Excel export (tab-separated, Norwegian headers, same column order and formatting)

### Import
- Import from `.xlsx` or `.csv` via SheetJS — available under **⚙️ Innstillinger → Datafil**
- Preview before confirming; duplicates skipped automatically (matched on date + distance + duration)
- Maps all Norwegian column headers from the original Excel workbook

### Settings (Innstillinger)
- **Yearly goals** — set a km target per year; tracked on the dashboard
- **Profil & Puls** — max HR, resting HR, 5 zone boundaries; auto-calculate zones from max HR
- **Treningsrytme** — km-grense and løp-grense per week used to compute the consistency score
- **Sko** — manage shoe list with km totals; **Pensjonér** a shoe to hide it from the form dropdown while keeping historical data; **Aktiver** restores it; used in the log filter and form dropdown
- **Datafil** — open, create, download, import Excel/CSV, or clear all data; **Lokale sikkerhetskopier** — automatic daily snapshots stored in browser IndexedDB (last 7 days), with one-click restore

## Firefox

Firefox does not support the File System Access API, so auto-save is unavailable.

- Load data: **⚙️ Innstillinger** → **📂 Åpne fil** (standard file input)
- Save data: **⚙️ Innstillinger** → **⬇️ Last ned** after each session to download the updated JSON
- Re-open the downloaded file next time to continue where you left off
